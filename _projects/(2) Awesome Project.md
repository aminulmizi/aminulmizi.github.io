# Ferrari-F40 in CAD

Upon completing a LinkedIn Learning tutorial on Fusion 360, a CAD programme developed by AutoDesk, I began designing random objects
in Fusion 360 to progress my skills in CAD. My first major project was desinging a model rocket which had product specifications. 
This was the same rocket I used to simulate a rocket launch which you can check out here.
