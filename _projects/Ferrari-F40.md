<p>Upon completing a LinkedIn Learning tutorial on Fusion 360, I began designing random objects
in Fusion 360 to progress my skills in CAD. My first major project was desinging a model rocket which had product specifications. 
This was the same rocket I used to simulate a rocket launch which you can check out here.

<h3>Adding the canvas</h3>
Before starting, I needed to find the blueprints of the Ferrari F40, this would give me dimensions of the car. After finding blueprints I was then able to use them as canvases to guide the build. I imported them in, and then calibrated them to the dimensions that were showed in the blueprints.
