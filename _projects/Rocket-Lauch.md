<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Simulating a rocket launch</u></h1>
<p>The aim of this project was to design and model a rocket in CAD to set specifications and then, using the 3D model, simulate a rocket launch using Blender. Using Unity I will then make this aniamtion viewable in the VR world</p>

<h3 id="rocket">Designing the rocket</h3>
<p>I needed to create the model of the rocket that was going to be used in the animation. This was done using Fusion 360. I set specifications for the rocket to meet and broke the rocket down into four sections; The base, main body, nose cone and a parachute clip. The idea was to model the rocket like I was going to have it manufactured afterwards, this meant all my measurements needed to be precise. The height of the rocket was going to be 30cm tall and have a diameter of 41.5mm. The holding bay for the rocket engine in the base will have a diameter of 30mm to house any 29mm rocket engine. </p>
<h4>The base</h4>
<p>To begin with, I set out by sketching 3 circles with the inner circle having a diameter of 31mm. I then extruded all three to height of 60mm, before extruding the inner circle out a bit more to make the total height 65mm. The 5mm extra material will slot into the main body.

Next I added the fins. First, I made a recrtangle 40mm long, and extruded it upwards 60mm to the top of the base and then a further 15mm. This meant the fins would be 75mm tall. Next I made sketches on the rectangle to give create three shapes, one of them being the fin. The other two shapes, I extruded them inwards to cut themselves out. This left me with just the fin.

Using the circular pattern function, I duplicated the fin 2 more times around the cylindrical base. Next I used the fillet command on the sharp edges to smooth them down. To make sure that the base would grip into the main body, I input a new canvas halfway up the lip and sketched out another circle 1mm in diamter larger than the base. I then extruded this slightly.

To launch this model rocket, it will need a launch rod to be inserted through the rocket to guide it during it's inital liftoff. I added a launch lug to the side of the base to help with this. The diameter is 15mm.

<h4>Main body</h4>
<p>Building the main body was simple, it was just a circle of diameter 39.5mm which was then extruded to a height of 100mm
